# ChatGPT told me to learn this!

To start learning system architecture, it's best to begin with foundational concepts and progressively move towards more complex topics. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started, along with textbook recommendations:

###  1. Foundational Concepts
  ##### What to Learn:
    Computer Organization: Learn the basic structure of computer hardware, 
      how data flows, and how components like processors, memory, 
      and I/O devices work together.
    
    Operating Systems: Understanding how operating systems manage hardware 
      and software resources is crucial.

    Networking Basics: Learn how computers communicate over networks, 
      the role of protocols, and network layers.
  
  ##### Books:
    "Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface" -- David A. Patterson 
                                                                        and John L. Hennessy 
        -> This book is a solid foundation for understanding how computers 
            are built and how hardware and software interact.
    
    "Operating System Concepts" -- Abraham Silberschatz, Peter B. Galvin, and Greg Gagne
        -> This textbook covers operating system fundamentals, including process management, 
            memory management, and file systems.


### 2. Intermediate Concepts
  ##### What to Learn:
    System Design and Architecture Patterns: Learn architectural patterns 
      like monolithic, microservices, and distributed systems.
    
    Scalability, Performance, and Reliability: Understand how to design systems 
      that scale and ensure high availability.
    
    Cloud Computing: Study how cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, 
      and Google Cloud impact system architecture.
  
  ##### Books:
    "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" -- Martin Kleppmann
          -> This book covers the architectural patterns of modern systems, focusing on databases, 
              distributed systems, and scalability.
    "Software Architecture in Practice" -- Len Bass, Paul Clements, and Rick Kazman
          -> This book covers the principles and practices needed to design and implement 
              software architectures in large systems.


### 3. Advanced Topics
  ##### What to Learn:
    Distributed Systems: Dive deeper into distributed algorithms, 
      consensus mechanisms, and data consistency models.
    
    Security in Architecture: Study how to secure system architecture, 
      including encryption, access control, and threat modeling.
    
    DevOps & Infrastructure as Code: Learn how automation and continuous 
      integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines are integrated 
      into system architecture.
  
  ##### Books:
    "Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms" -- Andrew S. Tanenbaum and Maarten Van Steen
          -> A comprehensive guide to distributed system architecture and principles.
    "The DevOps Handbook" -- Gene Kim, Patrick Debois, John Willis, and Jez Humble
          -> Focuses on integrating development and operations through architecture.


### 4. Practical Learning
  ##### What to Learn:
    Hands-on practice is key! Use platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or 
      Azure to experiment with building scalable systems.
    Build and scale systems using Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration.

This path, combining theory from textbooks and hands-on experience, will give you a solid grasp of system architecture.
